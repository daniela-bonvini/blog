    <h1>About me</h1>
    <p>
      Hi, I'm Daniela, I'm a software engineer and I love to learn new things. Having studied foreign languages for many years, I stumbled upon HTML
      and CSS and have been fascinated by the frontend side of programming ever since, marveling at the enormous creativity this world offers. I like
      to think of the web as a blank canvas, and I'm always excited to craft something new with code. I love the challenge of creating something
      visually appealing and functional that people can interact with and enjoy. I've decided to start this blog as a memento for myself to remember
      what I've learned in my day-to-day coding and to share my knowledge with others. I hope you'll find something useful here!
