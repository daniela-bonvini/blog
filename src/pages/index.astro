  <p>
    Welcome to my learning blog! Some time ago I found out about the concept of <a href="https://blackgirlbytes.dev/how-to-learn-in-public"
      >learning in public</a
    > but I never really had the chance to try it out. That was until recently I heard lots of good things about Astro, and knowing it is perfect to create
    a blog, I thought it would be a great opportunity to get two birds with one stone and both learn about it and create a personal blog in which jot down
    everything new I come across and save it for future reference (mine and others both). As I'm still learning about Astro's features the site will probably
    change a lot in the next couple of weeks/months, as I will be adding new features and trying out new things. So here you go, come with me on this amazing
    learning journey!
